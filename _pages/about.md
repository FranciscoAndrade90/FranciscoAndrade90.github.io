Starting February 1st 2025, I am a postodctoral researcher based at Montpellier and working in the [PreMeDICaL](https://team.inria.fr/premedical) INRIA-Inserm team led by [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com). I also work with the (Paris based) INRIA-Inserm team [HeKA](https://team.inria.fr/heka/fr). 

Before that, I was a CNRS postodoctoral researcher in the [Centre Sciences des Données de de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://csd.ens.psl.eu) working with [Gabriel Peyré](https://www.gpeyre.com) and [Clarice Poon](https://cmhsp2.github.io) on *Inverse Problems* and *Optimal transport*. 

During my PhD ([IST Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt)) I worked on *Distributed optimization* under the supervision of [Mário Figueiredo](https://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf) and João Xavier.
